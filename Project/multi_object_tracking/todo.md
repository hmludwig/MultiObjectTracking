# Todo:

* Draw Bounding Boxes from CameraDetection on Images (done)
    * extract bounding boxes from the protobufs
* Set up Kalman Filter
    * This needs to be done for every tracked object
    
    * Tracks need to be deleted if their scores fall below a certain threshold (e.g. no measurements can be associated with them)
* Metrics
    * We need to evaluate the performance of the tracker
