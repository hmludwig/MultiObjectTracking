# MultiObjectTracking

We use dataset_2 which has to be present in the repo folder. Simply running the [object_detection.py](https://github.com/hmludwig/MultiObjectTracking/blob/objectDetection/object_detection.py) produces the [output_video.avi](https://github.com/hmludwig/MultiObjectTracking/blob/objectDetection/output_video.avi) showing our detections in action as well as a pickled dictionary [output_data.pkl](https://github.com/hmludwig/MultiObjectTracking/blob/objectDetection/output_data.tar.xz) where the key is the frame number and the corresponding value is a (detections, bev_map) tuple. The [objectDetection_metric.ipynb](https://github.com/hmludwig/MultiObjectTracking/blob/objectDetection/objectDetection_metric.ipynb) notebook shows the performance of the model compared to the ground truth.
